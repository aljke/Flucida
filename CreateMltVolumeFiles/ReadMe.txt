This is purely designed and implemented app. It contains some bugs and pure code without any test coverage.

Tasks:
* Explain what the app does.
* Describe existing bugs.
* Refactor implementation to fix bugs and improve maintainability of the code.
* Introduce sufficient test coverage.

Time:
* 60 minutes
* Whatever you can do in 60 minutes is fine. The goal is not getting the perfect solution putting too much effort into it. The goal is to get better code.
